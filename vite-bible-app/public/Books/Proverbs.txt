Proverbs 1
The Usefulness Of Proverbs
1The proverbs (truths obscurely expressed, maxims) of Solomon son of David, king of Israel: 2To know [skillful and godly] wisdom and instruction;
To discern and comprehend the words of understanding and insight, 3To receive instruction in wise behavior and the discipline of wise thoughtfulness,
Righteousness, justice, and integrity; 4That prudence (good judgment, astute common sense) may be given to the naive or inexperienced [who are easily misled],
And knowledge and discretion (intelligent discernment) to the youth, 5The wise will hear and increase their learning,
And the person of understanding will acquire wise counsel and the skill [to steer his course wisely and lead others to the truth], 6To understand a proverb and a figure [of speech] or an enigma with its interpretation,
And the words of the wise and their riddles [that require reflection]. 7The [reverent] fear of the LORD [that is, worshiping Him and regarding Him as truly awesome] is the beginning and the preeminent part of knowledge [its starting point and its essence];
But arrogant fools despise [skillful and godly] wisdom and instruction and self-discipline. The Enticement of Sinners 8My son, hear the instruction of your father,
And do not reject the teaching of your mother. 9For they are a garland of grace on your head,
And chains and ornaments [of gold] around your neck. 10My son, if sinners entice you,
Do not consent. 11If they say, “Come with us;
Let us lie in wait to shed blood,
Let us ambush the innocent without cause; 12Let us swallow them alive like Sheol (the place of the dead),
Even whole, as those who go down to the pit [of death]; 13We will find and take all kinds of precious possessions,
We will fill our houses with spoil; 14Throw in your lot with us [they insist];
We will all have one money bag [in common],” 15My son, do not walk on the road with them;
Keep your foot [far] away from their path, 16For their feet run to evil,
And they hurry to shed blood. 17Indeed, it is useless to spread the baited net
In the sight of any bird; 18But [when these people set a trap for others] they lie in wait for their own blood;
They set an ambush for their own lives [and rush to their destruction]. 19So are the ways of everyone who is greedy for gain;
Greed takes away the lives of its possessors. Wisdom Warns 20Wisdom shouts in the street,
She raises her voice in the markets; 21She calls out at the head of the noisy streets [where large crowds gather];
At the entrance of the city gates she speaks her words: 22“How long, O naive ones [you who are easily misled], will you love being simple-minded and undiscerning?
How long will scoffers [who ridicule and deride] delight in scoffing,
How long will fools [who obstinately mock truth] hate knowledge? 23“If you will turn and pay attention to my rebuke,
Behold, I [Wisdom] will pour out my spirit on you;
I will make my words known to you. 24“Because I called and you refused [to answer],
I stretched out my hand and no one has paid attention [to my offer]; 25And you treated all my counsel as nothing
And would not accept my reprimand, 26I also will laugh at your disaster;
I will mock when your dread and panic come, 27When your dread and panic come like a storm,
And your disaster comes like a whirlwind,
When anxiety and distress come upon you [as retribution]. 28“Then they will call upon me (Wisdom), but I will not answer;
They will seek me eagerly but they will not find me, 29Because they hated knowledge
And did not choose the fear of the LORD [that is, obeying Him with reverence and awe-filled respect], 30They would not accept my counsel,
And they spurned all my rebuke. 31“Therefore they shall eat of the fruit of their own [wicked] way
And be satiated with [the penalty of] their own devices. 32“For the turning away of the naive will kill them,
And the careless ease of [self-righteous] fools will destroy them. 33“But whoever listens to me (Wisdom) will live securely and in confident trust
And will be at ease, without fear or dread of evil.”

Proverbs 2
The Pursuit Of Wisdom Brings Security
1My son, if you will receive my words
And treasure my commandments within you, 2So that your ear is attentive to [skillful and godly] wisdom,
And apply your heart to understanding [seeking it conscientiously and striving for it eagerly]; 3Yes, if you cry out for insight,
And lift up your voice for understanding; 4If you seek skillful and godly wisdom as you would silver
And search for her as you would hidden treasures; 5Then you will understand the [reverent] fear of the LORD [that is, worshiping Him and regarding Him as truly awesome]
And discover the knowledge of God. 6For the LORD gives [skillful and godly] wisdom;
From His mouth come knowledge and understanding. 7He stores away sound wisdom for the righteous [those who are in right standing with Him];
He is a shield to those who walk in integrity [those of honorable character and moral courage], 8He guards the paths of justice;
And He preserves the way of His saints (believers). 9Then you will understand righteousness and justice [in every circumstance]
And integrity and every good path. 10For [skillful and godly] wisdom will enter your heart
And knowledge will be pleasant to your soul. 11Discretion will watch over you,
Understanding and discernment will guard you, 12To keep you from the way of evil and the evil man,
From the man who speaks perverse things; 13From those who leave the paths of uprightness
To walk in the ways of darkness; 14Who find joy in doing evil
And delight in the perversity of evil, 15Whose paths are crooked,
And who are devious in their ways; 16To keep you from the immoral woman;
From the seductress with her flattering words, 17Who leaves the companion (husband) of her youth,
And forgets the covenant of her God. 18For her house leads down to death
And her paths lead to the dead; 19None who go to her return again,
Nor do they regain the paths of life— 20So you will walk in the way of good men [that is, those of personal integrity, moral courage and honorable character],
And keep to the paths of the righteous. 21For the upright [those who are in right standing with God] will live in the land
And those [of integrity] who are blameless [in God’s sight] will remain in it; 22But the wicked will be cut off from the land
And the treacherous shall be [forcibly] uprooted and removed from it.

Proverbs 3
The Rewards Of Wisdom
1My son, do not forget my teaching,
But let your heart keep my commandments; 2For length of days and years of life [worth living]
And tranquility and prosperity [the wholeness of life’s blessings] they will add to you. 3Do not let mercy and kindness and truth leave you [instead let these qualities define you];
Bind them [securely] around your neck,
Write them on the tablet of your heart. 4So find favor and high esteem
In the sight of God and man. 5Trust in and rely confidently on the LORD with all your heart
And do not rely on your own insight or understanding. 6In all your ways know and acknowledge and recognize Him,
And He will make your paths straight and smooth [removing obstacles that block your way]. 7Do not be wise in your own eyes;
Fear the LORD [with reverent awe and obedience] and turn [entirely] away from evil. 8It will be health to your body [your marrow, your nerves, your sinews, your muscles—all your inner parts]
And refreshment (physical well-being) to your bones. 9Honor the LORD with your wealth
And with the first fruits of all your crops (income); 10Then your barns will be abundantly filled
And your vats will overflow with new wine. 11My son, do not reject or take lightly the discipline of the LORD [learn from your mistakes and the testing that comes from His correction through discipline];
Nor despise His rebuke, 12For those whom the LORD loves He corrects,
Even as a father corrects the son in whom he delights. 13Happy [blessed, considered fortunate, to be admired] is the man who finds [skillful and godly] wisdom,
And the man who gains understanding and insight [learning from God’s word and life’s experiences], 14For wisdom’s profit is better than the profit of silver,
And her gain is better than fine gold. 15She is more precious than rubies;
And nothing you can wish for compares with her [in value]. 16Long life is in her right hand;
In her left hand are riches and honor. 17Her ways are highways of pleasantness and favor,
And all her paths are peace. 18She is a tree of life to those who take hold of her,
And happy [blessed, considered fortunate, to be admired] is everyone who holds her tightly. 19The LORD by His wisdom has founded the earth;
By His understanding He has established the heavens. 20By His knowledge the deeps were broken up
And the clouds drip with dew. 21My son, let them not escape from your sight,
But keep sound wisdom and discretion, 22And they will be life to your soul (your inner self)
And a gracious adornment to your neck (your outer self). 23Then you will walk on your way [of life] securely
And your foot will not stumble. 24When you lie down, you will not be afraid;
When you lie down, your sleep will be sweet. 25Do not be afraid of sudden fear
Nor of the storm of the wicked when it comes [since you will be blameless]; 26For the LORD will be your confidence, firm and strong,
And will keep your foot from being caught [in a trap]. 27Do not withhold good from those to whom it is due [its rightful recipients],
When it is in your power to do it. 28Do not say to your neighbor, “Go, and come back,
And tomorrow I will give it,”
When you have it with you. 29Do not devise evil against your neighbor,
Who lives securely beside you. 30Do not quarrel with a man without cause,
If he has done you no harm. 31Do not envy a man of violence
And do not choose any of his ways. 32For the devious are repulsive to the LORD;
But His private counsel is with the upright [those with spiritual integrity and moral courage]. 33The curse of the LORD is on the house of the wicked,
But He blesses the home of the just and righteous. 34Though He scoffs at the scoffers and scorns the scorners,
Yet He gives His grace [His undeserved favor] to the humble [those who give up self-importance]. 35The wise will inherit honor and glory,
But dishonor and shame is conferred on fools.

Proverbs 4
A Father’s Instruction
1Hear, O children, the instruction of a father,
And pay attention [and be willing to learn] so that you may gain understanding and intelligent discernment. 2For I give you good doctrine;
Do not turn away from my instruction. 3When I was a son with my father (David),
Tender and the only son in the sight of my mother (Bathsheba), 4He taught me and said to me,
“Let your heart hold fast my words;
Keep my commandments and live. 5“Get [skillful and godly] wisdom! Acquire understanding [actively seek spiritual discernment, mature comprehension, and logical interpretation]!
Do not forget nor turn away from the words of my mouth. 6“Do not turn away from her (Wisdom) and she will guard and protect you;
Love her, and she will watch over you. 7“The beginning of wisdom is: Get [skillful and godly] wisdom [it is preeminent]!
And with all your acquiring, get understanding [actively seek spiritual discernment, mature comprehension, and logical interpretation]. 8“Prize wisdom [and exalt her], and she will exalt you;
She will honor you if you embrace her. 9“She will place on your head a garland of grace;
She will present you with a crown of beauty and glory.” 10Hear, my son, and accept my sayings,
And the years of your life will be many. 11I have instructed you in the way of [skillful and godly] wisdom;
I have led you in upright paths. 12When you walk, your steps will not be impeded [for your path will be clear and open];
And when you run, you will not stumble. 13Take hold of instruction; [actively seek it, grip it firmly and] do not let go.
Guard her, for she is your life. 14Do not enter the path of the wicked,
And do not go the way of evil men. 15Avoid it, do not travel on it;
Turn away from it and pass on. 16For the wicked cannot sleep unless they do evil;
And they are deprived of sleep unless they make someone stumble and fall. 17For they eat the bread of wickedness
And drink the wine of violence. 18But the path of the just (righteous) is like the light of dawn,
That shines brighter and brighter until [it reaches its full strength and glory in] the perfect day. 19The way of the wicked is like [deep] darkness;
They do not know over what they stumble. 20My son, pay attention to my words and be willing to learn;
Open your ears to my sayings. 21Do not let them escape from your sight;
Keep them in the center of your heart. 22For they are life to those who find them,
And healing and health to all their flesh. 23Watch over your heart with all diligence,
For from it flow the springs of life. 24Put away from you a deceitful (lying, misleading) mouth,
And put devious lips far from you. 25Let your eyes look directly ahead [toward the path of moral courage]
And let your gaze be fixed straight in front of you [toward the path of integrity]. 26Consider well and watch carefully the path of your feet,
And all your ways will be steadfast and sure. 27Do not turn away to the right nor to the left [where evil may lurk];
Turn your foot from [the path of] evil.

Proverbs 5
Pitfalls Of Immorality
1My son, be attentive to my wisdom [godly wisdom learned by costly experience],
Incline your ear to my understanding; 2That you may exercise discrimination and discretion (good judgment),
And your lips may reserve knowledge and answer wisely [to temptation]. 3For the lips of an immoral woman drip honey [like a honeycomb]
And her speech is smoother than oil; 4But in the end she is bitter like [the extract of] wormwood,
Sharp as a two-edged sword. 5Her feet go down to death;
Her steps take hold of Sheol (the nether world, the place of the dead), 6So that she does not think [seriously] about the path of life;
Her ways are aimless and unstable; you cannot know where her path leads. 7Now then, my sons, listen to me
And do not depart from (forget) the words of my mouth. 8Let your way [in life] be far from her,
And do not go near the door of her house [avoid even being near the places of temptation], 9Or you will give your honor to others,
And your years to the cruel one, 10And strangers will be filled with your strength
And your hard-earned wealth will go to the house of a foreigner [who does not know God]; 11And you will groan when your life is ending,
When your flesh and your body are consumed; 12And you say, “How I hated instruction and discipline,
And my heart despised correction and reproof! 13“I have not listened to the voice of my teachers,
Nor have I inclined my ear to those who instructed me. 14“I was almost in total ruin
In the midst of the assembly and congregation.” 15Drink water from your own cistern [of a pure marriage relationship]
And fresh running water from your own well. 16Should your springs (children) be dispersed,
As streams of water in the streets? 17[Confine yourself to your own wife.] Let your children be yours alone,
And not the children of strangers with you. 18Let your fountain (wife) be blessed [with the rewards of fidelity],
And rejoice in the wife of your youth. 19Let her be as a loving hind and graceful doe,
Let her breasts refresh and satisfy you at all times;
Always be exhilarated and delight in her love. 20Why should you, my son, be exhilarated with an immoral woman
And embrace the bosom of an outsider (pagan)? 21For the ways of man are directly before the eyes of the LORD,
And He carefully watches all of his paths [all of his comings and goings]. 22The iniquities done by a wicked man will trap him,
And he will be held with the cords of his sin. 23He will die for lack of instruction (discipline),
And in the greatness of his foolishness he will go astray and be lost.

Proverbs 6
Parental Counsel
1My son, if you have become surety (guaranteed a debt or obligation) for your neighbor,
If you have given your pledge for [the debt of] a stranger or another [outside your family], 2If you have been snared with the words of your lips,
If you have been trapped by the speech of your mouth, 3Do this now, my son, and release yourself [from the obligation];
Since you have come into the hand of your neighbor,
Go humble yourself, and plead with your neighbor [to pay his debt and release you]. 4Give no [unnecessary] sleep to your eyes,
Nor slumber to your eyelids; 5Tear yourself away like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter
And like a bird from the hand of the fowler. 6Go to the ant, O lazy one;
Observe her ways and be wise, 7Which, having no chief,
Overseer or ruler, 8She prepares her food in the summer
And brings in her provisions [of food for the winter] in the harvest. 9How long will you lie down, O lazy one?
When will you arise from your sleep [and learn self-discipline]? 10“Yet a little sleep, a little slumber,
A little folding of the hands to lie down and rest”— 11So your poverty will come like an approaching prowler who walks [slowly, but surely]
And your need [will come] like an armed man [making you helpless]. 12A worthless person, a wicked man,
Is one who walks with a perverse (corrupt, vulgar) mouth. 13Who winks with his eyes [in mockery], who shuffles his feet [to signal],
Who points with his fingers [to give subversive instruction]; 14Who perversely in his heart plots trouble and evil continually;
Who spreads discord and strife. 15Therefore [the crushing weight of] his disaster will come suddenly upon him;
Instantly he will be broken, and there will be no healing or remedy [because he has no heart for God]. 16These six things the LORD hates;
Indeed, seven are repulsive to Him: 17A proud look [the attitude that makes one overestimate oneself and discount others], a lying tongue,
And hands that shed innocent blood, 18A heart that creates wicked plans,
Feet that run swiftly to evil, 19A false witness who breathes out lies [even half-truths],
And one who spreads discord (rumors) among brothers. 20My son, be guided by your father’s [God-given] commandment (instruction)
And do not reject the teaching of your mother; 21Bind them continually upon your heart (in your thoughts),
And tie them around your neck. 22When you walk about, they (the godly teachings of your parents) will guide you;
When you sleep, they will keep watch over you;
And when you awake, they will talk to you. 23For the commandment is a lamp, and the teaching [of the law] is light,
And reproofs (rebukes) for discipline are the way of life, 24To keep you from the evil woman,
From [the flattery of] the smooth tongue of an immoral woman. 25Do not desire (lust after) her beauty in your heart,
Nor let her capture you with her eyelashes. 26For on account of a prostitute one is reduced to a piece of bread [to be eaten up],
And the immoral woman hunts [with a hook] the precious life [of a man]. 27Can a man take fire to his chest
And his clothes not be burned? 28Or can a man walk on hot coals
And his feet not be scorched? 29So is the one who goes in to his neighbor’s wife;
Whoever touches her will not be found innocent or go unpunished. 30People do not despise a thief if he steals
To satisfy himself when he is hungry; 31But when he is found, he must repay seven times [what he stole];
He must give all the property of his house [if necessary to meet his fine]. 32But whoever commits adultery with a woman lacks common sense and sound judgment and an understanding [of moral principles];
He who would destroy his soul does it. 33Wounds and disgrace he will find,
And his reproach (blame) will not be blotted out. 34For jealousy enrages the [wronged] husband;
He will not spare [the guilty one] on the day of vengeance. 35He will not accept any ransom [offered to buy him off from demanding full punishment];
Nor will he be satisfied though you offer him many gifts (bribes).

Proverbs 7
The Wiles Of The Prostitute
1My son, keep my words
And treasure my commandments within you [so they are readily available to guide you]. 2Keep my commandments and live,
And keep my teaching and law as the apple of your eye. 3Bind them [securely] on your fingers;
Write them on the tablet of your heart. 4Say to [skillful and godly] wisdom, “You are my sister,”
And regard understanding and intelligent insight as your intimate friends; 5That they may keep you from the immoral woman,
From the foreigner [who does not observe God’s laws and] who flatters with her [smooth] words. 6For at the window of my house
I looked out through my lattice. 7And among the naive [the inexperienced and gullible],
I saw among the youths
A young man lacking [good] sense, 8Passing through the street near her corner;
And he took the path to her house 9In the twilight, in the evening;
In the black and dark night. 10And there a woman met him,
Dressed as a prostitute and sly and cunning of heart. 11She was boisterous and rebellious;
She would not stay at home. 12At times she was in the streets, at times in the market places,
Lurking and setting her ambush at every corner. 13So she caught him and kissed him
And with a brazen and impudent face she said to him: 14“I have peace offerings with me;
Today I have paid my vows. 15“So I came out to meet you [that you might share with me the feast of my offering],
Diligently I sought your face and I have found you. 16“I have spread my couch with coverings and cushions of tapestry,
With colored fine linen of Egypt. 17“I have perfumed my bed
With myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon. 18“Come, let us drink our fill of love until morning;
Let us console and delight ourselves with love. 19“For my husband is not at home.
He has gone on a long journey; 20He has taken a bag of money with him,
And he will come home on the appointed day.” 21With her many persuasions she caused him to yield;
With her flattering lips she seduced him. 22Suddenly he went after her, as an ox goes to the slaughter [not knowing the outcome],
Or as one in stocks going to the correction [to be given] to a fool, 23Until an arrow pierced his liver [with a mortal wound];
Like a bird fluttering straight into the net,
He did not know that it would cost him his life. 24Now therefore, my sons, listen to me,
And pay attention to the words of my mouth. 25Do not let your heart turn aside to her ways,
Do not stray into her [evil, immoral] paths. 26For she has cast down many [mortally] wounded;
Indeed, all who were killed by her were strong. 27Her house is the way to Sheol,
Descending to the chambers of death.

Proverbs 8
The Commendation Of Wisdom
1Does not wisdom call,
And understanding lift up her voice? 2On the top of the heights beside the way,
Where the paths meet, wisdom takes her stand; 3Beside the gates, at the entrance to the city,
At the entrance of the doors, she cries out: 4“To you, O men, I call,
And my voice is directed to the sons of men. 5“O you naive or inexperienced [who are easily misled], understand prudence and seek astute common sense;
And, O you [closed-minded, self-confident] fools, understand wisdom [seek the insight and self-discipline that leads to godly living]. 6“Listen, for I will speak excellent and noble things;
And the opening of my lips will reveal right things. 7“For my mouth will utter truth,
And wickedness is repulsive and loathsome to my lips. 8“All the words of my mouth are in righteousness (upright, in right standing with God);
There is nothing contrary to truth or perverted (crooked) in them. 9“They are all straightforward to him who understands [with an open and willing mind],
And right to those who find knowledge and live by it. 10“Take my instruction rather than [seeking] silver,
And take knowledge rather than choicest gold, 11“For wisdom is better than rubies;
And all desirable things cannot compare with her. 12“I, [godly] wisdom, reside with prudence [good judgment, moral courage and astute common sense],
And I find knowledge and discretion. 13“The [reverent] fear and worshipful awe of the LORD includes the hatred of evil;
Pride and arrogance and the evil way,
And the perverted mouth, I hate. 14“Counsel is mine and sound wisdom;
I am understanding, power and strength are mine. 15“By me kings reign
And rulers decide and decree justice. 16“By me princes rule, and nobles,
All who judge and govern rightly. 17“I love those who love me;
And those who seek me early and diligently will find me. 18“Riches and honor are with me,
Enduring wealth and righteousness (right standing with God). 19“My fruit is better than gold, even pure gold,
And my yield is better than choicest silver. 20“I, [Wisdom, continuously] walk in the way of righteousness,
In the midst of the paths of justice, 21That I may cause those who love me to inherit wealth and true riches,
And that I may fill their treasuries. 22“The LORD created and possessed me at the beginning of His way,
Before His works of old [were accomplished]. 23“From everlasting I was established and ordained,
From the beginning, before the earth existed, [I, godly wisdom, existed]. 24“When there were no ocean depths I was born,
When there were no fountains and springs overflowing with water. 25“Before the mountains were settled,
Before the hills, I was born; 26While He had not yet made the earth and the fields,
Or the first of the dust of the earth. 27“When He established the heavens, I [Wisdom] was there;
When He drew a circle upon the face of the deep, 28When He made firm the skies above,
When the fountains and springs of the deep became fixed and strong, 29When He set for the sea its boundary
So that the waters would not transgress [the boundaries set by] His command,
When He marked out the foundations of the earth— 30Then I was beside Him, as a master craftsman;
And I was daily His delight;
Rejoicing before Him always, 31Rejoicing in the world, His inhabited earth,
And having my delight in the sons of men. 32“Now therefore, O sons, listen to me,
For blessed [happy, prosperous, to be admired] are they who keep my ways. 33“Heed (pay attention to) instruction and be wise,
And do not ignore or neglect it. 34“Blessed [happy, prosperous, to be admired] is the man who listens to me,
Watching daily at my gates,
Waiting at my doorposts. 35“For whoever finds me (Wisdom) finds life
And obtains favor and grace from the LORD. 36“But he who fails to find me or sins against me injures himself;
All those who hate me love and court death.”

Proverbs 9
Wisdom’s Invitation
1Wisdom has built her [spacious and sufficient] house;
She has hewn out and set up her seven pillars. 2She has prepared her food, she has mixed her wine;
She has also set her table. 3She has sent out her maidens, she calls
From the highest places of the city: 4“Whoever is naive or inexperienced, let him turn in here!”
As for him who lacks understanding, she says, 5“Come, eat my food
And drink the wine I have mixed [and accept my gifts]. 6“Leave [behind] your foolishness [and the foolish] and live,
And walk in the way of insight and understanding.” 7He who corrects and instructs a scoffer gets dishonor for himself,
And he who rebukes a wicked man gets insults for himself. 8Do not correct a scoffer [who foolishly ridicules and takes no responsibility for his error] or he will hate you;
Correct a wise man [who learns from his error], and he will love you. 9Give instruction to a wise man and he will become even wiser;
Teach a righteous man and he will increase his learning. 10The [reverent] fear of the LORD [that is, worshiping Him and regarding Him as truly awesome] is the beginning and the preeminent part of wisdom [its starting point and its essence],
And the knowledge of the Holy One is understanding and spiritual insight. 11For by me (wisdom from God) your days will be multiplied,
And years of life shall be increased. 12If you are wise, you are wise for yourself [for your own benefit];
If you scoff [thoughtlessly ridicule and disdain], you alone will pay the penalty. 13The foolish woman is restless and noisy;
She is naive and easily misled and thoughtless, and knows nothing at all [of eternal value]. 14She sits at the doorway of her house,
On a seat by the high and conspicuous places of the city, 15Calling to those who pass by,
Who are making their paths straight: 16“Whoever is naive or inexperienced, let him turn in here!”
And to him who lacks understanding (common sense), she says, 17“Stolen waters (pleasures) are sweet [because they are forbidden];
And bread eaten in secret is pleasant.” 18But he does not know that the spirits of the dead are there,
And that her guests are [already] in the depths of Sheol (the nether world, the place of the dead).

Proverbs 10
Contrast Of The Righteous And The Wicked
1The proverbs of Solomon: A wise son makes a father glad,
But a foolish [stubborn] son [who refuses to learn] is a grief to his mother. 2Treasures of wickedness and ill-gotten gains do not profit,
But righteousness and moral integrity in daily life rescues from death. 3The LORD will not allow the righteous to hunger [God will meet all his needs],
But He will reject and cast away the craving of the wicked. 4Poor is he who works with a negligent and idle hand,
But the hand of the diligent makes him rich. 5He who gathers during summer and takes advantage of his opportunities is a son who acts wisely,
But he who sleeps during harvest and ignores the moment of opportunity is a son who acts shamefully. 6Blessings are on the head of the righteous [the upright, those in right standing with God],
But the mouth of the wicked conceals violence. 7The memory of the righteous [person] is a blessing,
But the name of the wicked will [be forgotten and] rot [like a corpse]. 8The wise in heart [are willing to learn so they] will accept and obey commands (instruction),
But the babbling fool [who is arrogant and thinks himself wise] will come to ruin. 9He who walks in integrity and with moral character walks securely,
But he who takes a crooked way will be discovered and punished. 10He who [maliciously] winks the eye [of evil intent] causes trouble;
And the babbling fool [who is arrogant and thinks himself wise] will come to ruin. 11The mouth of the righteous is a fountain of life and his words of wisdom are a source of blessing,
But the mouth of the wicked conceals violence and evil. 12Hatred stirs up strife,
But love covers and overwhelms all transgressions [forgiving and overlooking another’s faults]. 13On the lips of the discerning, [skillful and godly] wisdom is found,
But discipline and the rod are for the back of the one who is without common sense and understanding. 14Wise men store up and treasure knowledge [in mind and heart],
But with the mouth of the foolish, ruin is at hand. 15The rich man’s wealth is his fortress;
The ruin of the poor is their poverty. 16The wages of the righteous [the upright, those in right standing with God] is [a worthwhile, meaningful] life,
The income of the wicked, punishment. 17He who learns from instruction and correction is on the [right] path of life [and for others his example is a path toward wisdom and blessing],
But he who ignores and refuses correction goes off course [and for others his example is a path toward sin and ruin]. 18He who hides hatred has lying lips,
And he who spreads slander is a fool. 19When there are many words, transgression and offense are unavoidable,
But he who controls his lips and keeps thoughtful silence is wise. 20The tongue of the righteous is like precious silver (greatly valued);
The heart of the wicked is worth little. 21The lips of the righteous feed and guide many,
But fools [who reject God and His wisdom] die for lack of understanding. 22The blessing of the LORD brings [true] riches,
And He adds no sorrow to it [for it comes as a blessing from God]. 23Engaging in evil is like sport to the fool [who refuses wisdom and chases sin],
But to a man of understanding [skillful and godly] wisdom brings joy. 24What the wicked fears will come upon him,
But the desire of the righteous [for the blessings of God] will be granted. 25When the whirlwind passes, the wicked is no more,
But the righteous has an everlasting foundation. 26Like vinegar to the teeth and smoke to the eyes,
So is the lazy one to those who send him to work. 27The [reverent] fear of the LORD [worshiping, obeying, serving, and trusting Him with awe-filled respect] prolongs one’s life,
But the years of the wicked will be shortened. 28The hope of the righteous [those of honorable character and integrity] is joy,
But the expectation of the wicked [those who oppose God and ignore His wisdom] comes to nothing. 29The way of the LORD is a stronghold to the upright,
But it is ruin to those who do evil. 30The [consistently] righteous will never be shaken,
But the wicked will not inhabit the earth. 31The mouth of the righteous flows with [skillful and godly] wisdom,
But the perverted tongue will be cut out. 32The lips of the righteous know (speak) what is acceptable,
But the mouth of the wicked knows (speaks) what is perverted (twisted).

Proverbs 11
Contrast The Upright And The Wicked
1A false balance and dishonest business practices are extremely offensive to the LORD,
But an accurate scale is His delight. 2When pride comes [boiling up with an arrogant attitude of self-importance], then come dishonor and shame,
But with the humble [the teachable who have been chiseled by trial and who have learned to walk humbly with God] there is wisdom and soundness of mind. 3The integrity and moral courage of the upright will guide them,
But the crookedness of the treacherous will destroy them. 4Riches will not provide security in the day of wrath and judgment,
But righteousness rescues from death. 5The righteousness of the blameless will smooth their way and keep it straight,
But the wicked will fall by his own wickedness. 6The righteousness of the upright will rescue them,
But the treacherous will be caught by their own greed. 7When the wicked man dies, his expectation will perish;
And the hope of [godless] strong men perishes. 8The righteous is rescued from trouble,
And the wicked takes his place. 9With his mouth the godless man destroys his neighbor,
But through knowledge and discernment the righteous will be rescued. 10When it goes well for the righteous, the city rejoices,
And when the wicked perish, there are shouts of joy. 11By the blessing [of the influence] of the upright the city is exalted,
But by the mouth of the wicked it is torn down. 12He who despises his neighbor lacks sense,
But a man of understanding keeps silent. 13He who goes about as a gossip reveals secrets,
But he who is trustworthy and faithful keeps a matter hidden. 14Where there is no [wise, intelligent] guidance, the people fall [and go off course like a ship without a helm],
But in the abundance of [wise and godly] counselors there is victory. 15He who puts up security and guarantees a debt for an outsider will surely suffer [for his foolishness],
But he who hates (declines) being a guarantor is secure [from its penalties]. 16A gracious and good woman attains honor,
And ruthless men attain riches [but not respect]. 17The merciful and generous man benefits his soul [for his behavior returns to bless him],
But the cruel and callous man does himself harm. 18The wicked man earns deceptive wages,
But he who sows righteousness and lives his life with integrity will have a true reward [that is both permanent and satisfying]. 19He who is steadfast in righteousness attains life,
But he who pursues evil attains his own death. 20The perverse in heart are repulsive and shamefully vile to the LORD,
But those who are blameless and above reproach in their walk are His delight! 21Assuredly, the evil man will not go unpunished,
But the descendants of the righteous will be freed. 22As a ring of gold in a swine’s snout,
So is a beautiful woman who is without discretion [her lack of character mocks her beauty]. 23The desire of the righteous brings only good,
But the expectation of the wicked brings wrath. 24There is the one who [generously] scatters [abroad], and yet increases all the more;
And there is the one who withholds what is justly due, but it results only in want and poverty. 25The generous man [is a source of blessing and] shall be prosperous and enriched,
And he who waters will himself be watered [reaping the generosity he has sown]. 26The people curse him who holds back grain [when the public needs it],
But a blessing [from God and man] is upon the head of him who sells it. 27He who diligently seeks good seeks favor and grace,
But he who seeks evil, evil will come to him. 28He who leans on and trusts in and is confident in his riches will fall,
But the righteous [who trust in God’s provision] will flourish like a green leaf. 29He who troubles (mismanages) his own house will inherit the wind (nothing),
And the foolish will be a servant to the wise-hearted. 30The fruit of the [consistently] righteous is a tree of life,
And he who is wise captures and wins souls [for God—he gathers them for eternity]. 31If the righteous will be rewarded on the earth [with godly blessings],
How much more [will] the wicked and the sinner [be repaid with punishment]!

Proverbs 12
Contrast The Upright And The Wicked
1Whoever loves instruction and discipline loves knowledge,
But he who hates reproof and correction is stupid. 2A good man will obtain favor from the LORD,
But He will condemn a man who devises evil. 3A man will not be established by wickedness,
But the root of the [consistently] righteous will not be moved. 4A virtuous and excellent wife [worthy of honor] is the crown of her husband,
But she who shames him [with her foolishness] is like rottenness in his bones. 5The thoughts and purposes of the [consistently] righteous are just (honest, reliable),
But the counsels and schemes of the wicked are deceitful. 6The [malevolent] words of the wicked lie in wait for [innocent] blood [to slander],
But the mouth of the upright will rescue and protect them. 7The wicked are overthrown [by their evil] and are no more,
But the house of the [consistently] righteous will stand [securely]. 8A man will be commended according to his insight and sound judgment,
But the one who is of a perverse mind will be despised. 9Better is he who is lightly esteemed and has a servant,
Than he who [boastfully] honors himself [pretending to be what he is not] and lacks bread. 10A righteous man has kind regard for the life of his animal,
But even the compassion of the wicked is cruel. 11He who tills his land will have plenty of bread,
But he who follows worthless things lacks common sense and good judgment. 12The wicked desire the plunder of evil men,
But the root of the righteous yields richer fruit. 13An evil man is [dangerously] ensnared by the transgression of his lips,
But the righteous will escape from trouble. 14A man will be satisfied with good from the fruit of his words,
And the deeds of a man’s hands will return to him [as a harvest]. 15The way of the [arrogant] fool [who rejects God’s wisdom] is right in his own eyes,
But a wise and prudent man is he who listens to counsel. 16The [arrogant] fool’s anger is quickly known [because he lacks self-control and common sense],
But a prudent man ignores an insult. 17He who speaks truth [when he testifies] tells what is right,
But a false witness utters deceit [in court]. 18There is one who speaks rashly like the thrusts of a sword,
But the tongue of the wise brings healing. 19Truthful lips will be established forever,
But a lying tongue is [credited] only for a moment. 20Deceit is in the heart of those who devise evil,
But counselors of peace have joy. 21No harm befalls the righteous,
But the wicked are filled with trouble. 22Lying lips are extremely disgusting to the LORD,
But those who deal faithfully are His delight. 23A shrewd man is reluctant to display his knowledge [until the proper time],
But the heart of [over-confident] fools proclaims foolishness. 24The hand of the diligent will rule,
But the negligent and lazy will be put to forced labor. 25Anxiety in a man’s heart weighs it down,
But a good (encouraging) word makes it glad. 26The righteous man is a guide to his neighbor,
But the way of the wicked leads them astray. 27The lazy man does not catch and roast his prey,
But the precious possession of a [wise] man is diligence [because he recognizes opportunities and seizes them]. 28In the way of righteousness is life,
And in its pathway there is no death [but immortality—eternal life].

Proverbs 13
Contrast The Upright And The Wicked
1A wise son heeds and accepts [and is the result of] his father’s discipline and instruction,
But a scoffer does not listen to reprimand and does not learn from his errors. 2From the fruit of his mouth a [wise] man enjoys good,
But the desire of the treacherous is for violence. 3The one who guards his mouth [thinking before he speaks] protects his life;
The one who opens his lips wide [and chatters without thinking] comes to ruin. 4The soul (appetite) of the lazy person craves and gets nothing [for lethargy overcomes ambition],
But the soul (appetite) of the diligent [who works willingly] is rich and abundantly supplied. 5A righteous man hates lies,
But a wicked man is loathsome, and he acts shamefully. 6Righteousness (being in right standing with God) guards the one whose way is blameless,
But wickedness undermines and overthrows the sinner. 7There is one who pretends to be rich, yet has nothing at all;
Another pretends to be poor, yet has great wealth. 8The ransom for a man’s life is his wealth,
But the poor man does not even have to listen to a rebuke or threats [from the envious]. 9The light of the righteous [within him—grows brighter and] rejoices,
But the lamp of the wicked [is a temporary light and] goes out. 10Through pride and presumption come nothing but strife,
But [skillful and godly] wisdom is with those who welcome [well-advised] counsel. 11Wealth obtained by fraud dwindles,
But he who gathers gradually by [honest] labor will increase [his riches]. 12Hope deferred makes the heart sick,
But when desire is fulfilled, it is a tree of life. 13Whoever despises the word and counsel [of God] brings destruction upon himself,
But he who [reverently] fears and respects the commandment [of God] will be rewarded. 14The teaching of the wise is a fountain and source of life,
So that one may avoid the snares of death. 15Good understanding wins favor [from others],
But the way of the unfaithful is hard [like barren, dry soil]. 16Every prudent and self-disciplined man acts with knowledge,
But a [closed-minded] fool [who refuses to learn] displays his foolishness [for all to see]. 17A wicked messenger falls into hardship,
But a faithful ambassador brings healing. 18Poverty and shame will come to him who refuses instruction and discipline,
But he who accepts and learns from reproof or censure is honored. 19Desire realized is sweet to the soul;
But it is detestable to fools to turn away from evil [which they have planned]. 20He who walks [as a companion] with wise men will be wise,
But the companions of [conceited, dull-witted] fools [are fools themselves and] will experience harm. 21Adversity pursues sinners,
But the [consistently] upright will be rewarded with prosperity. 22A good man leaves an inheritance to his children’s children,
And the wealth of the sinner is stored up for [the hands of] the righteous. 23Abundant food is in the fallow (uncultivated) ground of the poor,
But [without protection] it is swept away by injustice. 24He who withholds the rod [of discipline] hates his son,
But he who loves him disciplines and trains him diligently and appropriately [with wisdom and love]. 25The [consistently] righteous has enough to satisfy his appetite,
But the stomach of the wicked is in need [of bread].

Proverbs 14
Contrast The Upright And The Wicked
1The wise woman builds her house [on a foundation of godly precepts, and her household thrives],
But the foolish one [who lacks spiritual insight] tears it down with her own hands [by ignoring godly principles]. 2He who walks in uprightness [reverently] fears the LORD [and obeys and worships Him with profound respect],
But he who is devious in his ways despises Him. 3In the mouth of the [arrogant] fool [who rejects God] is a rod for his back,
But the lips of the wise [when they speak with godly wisdom] will protect them. 4Where there are no oxen, the manger is clean,
But much revenue [because of good crops] comes by the strength of the ox. 5A faithful and trustworthy witness will not lie,
But a false witness speaks lies. 6A scoffer seeks wisdom and finds none [for his ears are closed to wisdom],
But knowledge is easy for one who understands [because he is willing to learn]. 7Leave the presence of a [shortsighted] fool,
For you will not find knowledge or hear godly wisdom from his lips. 8The wisdom of the sensible is to understand his way,
But the foolishness of [shortsighted] fools is deceit. 9Fools mock sin [but sin mocks the fools],
But among the upright there is good will and the favor and blessing of God. 10The heart knows its own bitterness,
And no stranger shares its joy. 11The house of the wicked will be overthrown,
But the tent of the upright will thrive. 12There is a way which seems right to a man and appears straight before him,
But its end is the way of death. 13Even in laughter the heart may be in pain,
And the end of joy may be grief. 14The backslider in heart will have his fill with his own [rotten] ways,
But a good man will be satisfied with his ways [the godly thought and action which his heart pursues and in which he delights]. 15The naive or inexperienced person [is easily misled and] believes every word he hears,
But the prudent man [is discreet and astute and] considers well where he is going. 16A wise man suspects danger and cautiously avoids evil,
But the fool is arrogant and careless. 17A quick-tempered man acts foolishly and without self-control,
And a man of wicked schemes is hated. 18The naive [are unsophisticated and easy to exploit and] inherit foolishness,
But the sensible [are thoughtful and far-sighted and] are crowned with knowledge. 19The evil will bow down before the good,
And the wicked [will bow down] at the gates of the righteous. 20The poor man is hated even by his neighbor,
But those who love the rich are many. 21He who despises his neighbor sins [against God and his fellow man],
But happy [blessed and favored by God] is he who is gracious and merciful to the poor. 22Do they not go astray who devise evil and wander from the way of righteousness?
But kindness and truth will be to those who devise good. 23In all labor there is profit,
But mere talk leads only to poverty. 24The crown of the wise is their wealth [of wisdom],
But the foolishness of [closed-minded] fools is [nothing but] folly. 25A truthful witness saves lives,
But he who speaks lies is treacherous. 26In the [reverent] fear of the LORD there is strong confidence,
And His children will [always] have a place of refuge. 27The [reverent] fear of the LORD [that leads to obedience and worship] is a fountain of life,
So that one may avoid the snares of death. 28In a multitude of people is a king’s glory,
But in a lack of people is a [pretentious] prince’s ruin. 29He who is slow to anger has great understanding [and profits from his self-control],
But he who is quick-tempered exposes and exalts his foolishness [for all to see]. 30A calm and peaceful and tranquil heart is life and health to the body,
But passion and envy are like rottenness to the bones. 31He who oppresses the poor taunts and insults his Maker,
But he who is kind and merciful and gracious to the needy honors Him. 32The wicked is overthrown through his wrongdoing,
But the righteous has hope and confidence and a refuge [with God] even in death. 33Wisdom rests [silently] in the heart of one who has understanding,
But what is in the heart of [shortsighted] fools is made known. 34Righteousness [moral and spiritual integrity and virtuous character] exalts a nation,
But sin is a disgrace to any people. 35The king’s favor and good will are toward a servant who acts wisely and discreetly,
But his anger and wrath are toward him who acts shamefully.

Proverbs 15
Contrast The Upright And The Wicked
1A soft and gentle and thoughtful answer turns away wrath,
But harsh and painful and careless words stir up anger. 2The tongue of the wise speaks knowledge that is pleasing and acceptable,
But the [babbling] mouth of fools spouts folly. 3The eyes of the LORD are in every place,
Watching the evil and the good [in all their endeavors]. 4A soothing tongue [speaking words that build up and encourage] is a tree of life,
But a perversive tongue [speaking words that overwhelm and depress] crushes the spirit. 5A [flippant, arrogant] fool rejects his father’s instruction and correction,
But he who [is willing to learn and] regards and keeps in mind a reprimand acquires good sense. 6Great and priceless treasure is in the house of the [consistently] righteous one [who seeks godly instruction and grows in wisdom],
But trouble is in the income of the wicked one [who rejects the laws of God]. 7The lips of the wise spread knowledge [sifting it as chaff from the grain];
But the hearts of [shortsighted] fools are not so. 8The sacrifice of the wicked is hateful and exceedingly offensive to the LORD,
But the prayer of the upright is His delight! 9The way [of life] of the wicked is hateful and exceedingly offensive to the LORD,
But He loves one who pursues righteousness [personal integrity, moral courage and honorable character]. 10There is severe discipline for him who turns from the way [of righteousness];
And he who hates correction will die. 11Sheol (the nether world, the place of the dead) and Abaddon (the abyss, the place of eternal punishment) lie open before the LORD—
How much more the hearts and inner motives of the children of men. 12A scoffer [unlike a wise man] resents one who rebukes him and tries to teach him;
Nor will he go to the wise [for counsel and instruction]. 13A heart full of joy and goodness makes a cheerful face,
But when a heart is full of sadness the spirit is crushed. 14The mind of the intelligent and discerning seeks knowledge and eagerly inquires after it,
But the mouth of the [stubborn] fool feeds on foolishness. 15All the days of the afflicted are bad,
But a glad heart has a continual feast [regardless of the circumstances]. 16Better is a little with the [reverent, worshipful] fear of the LORD
Than great treasure and trouble with it. 17Better is a dinner of vegetables and herbs where love is present
Than a fattened ox served with hatred. 18A hot-tempered man stirs up strife,
But he who is slow to anger and patient calms disputes. 19The way of the lazy is like a hedge of thorns [it pricks, lacerates, and entangles him],
But the way [of life] of the upright is smooth and open like a highway. 20A wise son makes a father glad,
But a foolish man despises his mother. 21Foolishness is joy to him who is without heart and lacks [intelligent, common] sense,
But a man of understanding walks uprightly [making his course straight]. 22Without consultation and wise advice, plans are frustrated,
But with many counselors they are established and succeed. 23A man has joy in giving an appropriate answer,
And how good and delightful is a word spoken at the right moment—how good it is! 24The [chosen] path of life leads upward for the wise,
That he may keep away from Sheol (the nether world, the place of the dead) below. 25The LORD will tear down the house of the proud and arrogant (self-righteous),
But He will establish and protect the boundaries [of the land] of the [godly] widow. 26Evil plans and thoughts of the wicked are exceedingly vile and offensive to the LORD,
But pure words are pleasant words to Him. 27He who profits unlawfully brings suffering to his own house,
But he who hates bribes [and does not receive nor pay them] will live. 28The heart of the righteous thinks carefully about how to answer [in a wise and appropriate and timely way],
But the [babbling] mouth of the wicked pours out malevolent things. 29The LORD is far from the wicked [and distances Himself from them],
But He hears the prayer of the [consistently] righteous [that is, those with spiritual integrity and moral courage]. 30The light of the eyes rejoices the hearts of others,
And good news puts fat on the bones. 31The ear that listens to and learns from the life-giving rebuke (reprimand, censure)
Will remain among the wise. 32He who neglects and ignores instruction and discipline despises himself,
But he who learns from rebuke acquires understanding [and grows in wisdom]. 33The [reverent] fear of the LORD [that is, worshiping Him and regarding Him as truly awesome] is the instruction for wisdom [its starting point and its essence];
And before honor comes humility.

Proverbs 16
Contrast The Upright And The Wicked
1The plans and reflections of the heart belong to man,
But the [wise] answer of the tongue is from the LORD. 2All the ways of a man are clean and innocent in his own eyes [and he may see nothing wrong with his actions],
But the LORD weighs and examines the motives and intents [of the heart and knows the truth]. 3Commit your works to the LORD [submit and trust them to Him],
And your plans will succeed [if you respond to His will and guidance]. 4The LORD has made everything for its own purpose,
Even the wicked [according to their role] for the day of evil. 5Everyone who is proud and arrogant in heart is disgusting and exceedingly offensive to the LORD;
Be assured he will not go unpunished. 6By mercy and lovingkindness and truth [not superficial ritual] wickedness is cleansed from the heart,
And by the fear of the LORD one avoids evil. 7When a man’s ways please the LORD,
He makes even his enemies to be at peace with him. 8Better is a little with righteousness
Than great income [gained] with injustice. 9A man’s mind plans his way [as he journeys through life],
But the LORD directs his steps and establishes them. 10A divine decision [given by God] is on the lips of the king [as His representative];
His mouth should not be unfaithful or unjust in judgment. 11A just balance and [honest] scales are the LORD’S;
All the weights of the bag are His concern [established by His eternal principles]. 12It is repulsive [to God and man] for kings to behave wickedly,
For a throne is established on righteousness (right standing with God). 13Righteous lips are the delight of kings,
And he who speaks right is loved. 14The wrath of a king is like a messenger of death,
But a wise man will appease it. 15In the light of the king’s face is life,
And his favor is like a cloud bringing the spring rain. 16How much better it is to get wisdom than gold!
And to get understanding is to be chosen above silver. 17The highway of the upright turns away and departs from evil;
He who guards his way protects his life (soul). 18Pride goes before destruction,
And a haughty spirit before a fall. 19It is better to be humble in spirit with the lowly
Than to divide the spoil with the proud (haughty, arrogant). 20He who pays attention to the word [of God] will find good,
And blessed (happy, prosperous, to be admired) is he who trusts [confidently] in the LORD. 21The wise in heart will be called understanding,
And sweet speech increases persuasiveness and learning [in both speaker and listener]. 22Understanding (spiritual insight) is a [refreshing and boundless] wellspring of life to those who have it,
But to give instruction and correction to fools is foolishness. 23The heart of the wise instructs his mouth [in wisdom]
And adds persuasiveness to his lips. 24Pleasant words are like a honeycomb,
Sweet and delightful to the soul and healing to the body. 25There is a way which seems right to a man and appears straight before him,
But its end is the way of death. 26The appetite of a worker works for him,
For his hunger urges him on. 27A worthless man devises and digs up evil,
And the words on his lips are like a scorching fire. 28A perverse man spreads strife,
And one who gossips separates intimate friends. 29A violent and exceedingly covetous man entices his neighbor [to sin],
And leads him in a way that is not good. 30He who [slyly] winks his eyes does so to plot perverse things;
And he who compresses his lips [as if in a secret signal] brings evil to pass. 31The silver-haired head is a crown of splendor and glory;
It is found in the way of righteousness. 32He who is slow to anger is better and more honorable than the mighty [soldier],
And he who rules and controls his own spirit, than he who captures a city. 33The lot is cast into the lap,
But its every decision is from the LORD.

Proverbs 17
Contrast The Upright And The Wicked
1Better is a dry morsel [of food served] with quietness and peace
Than a house full of feasting [served] with strife and contention. 2A wise servant will rule over the [unworthy] son who acts shamefully and brings disgrace [to the family]
And [the worthy servant] will share in the inheritance among the brothers. 3The refining pot is for silver and the furnace for gold,
But the LORD tests hearts. 4An evildoer listens closely to wicked lips;
And a liar pays attention to a destructive and malicious tongue. 5Whoever mocks the poor taunts his Maker,
And he who rejoices at [another’s] disaster will not go unpunished. 6Grandchildren are the crown of aged men,
And the glory of children is their fathers [who live godly lives]. 7Excellent speech does not benefit a fool [who is spiritually blind],
Much less do lying lips benefit a prince. 8A bribe is like a bright, precious stone in the eyes of its owner;
Wherever he turns, he prospers. 9He who covers and forgives an offense seeks love,
But he who repeats or gossips about a matter separates intimate friends. 10A reprimand goes deeper into one who has understanding and a teachable spirit
Than a hundred lashes into a fool. 11A rebellious man seeks only evil;
Therefore a cruel messenger will be sent against him. 12Let a man meet a [ferocious] bear robbed of her cubs
Rather than the [angry, narcissistic] fool in his folly. 13Whoever returns evil for good,
Evil will not depart from his house. 14The beginning of strife is like letting out water [as from a small break in a dam; first it trickles and then it gushes];
Therefore abandon the quarrel before it breaks out and tempers explode. 15He who justifies the wicked, and he who condemns the righteous
Are both repulsive to the LORD. 16Why is there money in the hand of a fool to buy wisdom,
When he has no common sense or even a heart for it? 17A friend loves at all times,
And a brother is born for adversity. 18A man lacking common sense gives a pledge
And becomes guarantor [for the debt of another] in the presence of his neighbor. 19He who loves transgression loves strife and is quarrelsome;
He who [proudly] raises his gate seeks destruction [because of his arrogant pride]. 20He who has a crooked mind finds no good,
And he who is perverted in his language falls into evil. 21He who becomes the parent of a fool [who is spiritually blind] does so to his sorrow,
And the father of a fool [who is spiritually blind] has no joy. 22A happy heart is good medicine and a joyful mind causes healing,
But a broken spirit dries up the bones. 23A wicked man receives a bribe from the [hidden] pocket
To pervert the ways of justice. 24[Skillful and godly] wisdom is in the presence of a person of understanding [and he recognizes it],
But the eyes of a [thickheaded] fool are on the ends of the earth. 25A foolish son is a grief and anguish to his father
And bitterness to her who gave birth to him. 26It is also not good to fine the righteous,
Nor to strike the noble for their uprightness. 27He who has knowledge restrains and is careful with his words,
And a man of understanding and wisdom has a cool spirit (self-control, an even temper). 28Even a [callous, arrogant] fool, when he keeps silent, is considered wise;
When he closes his lips he is regarded as sensible (prudent, discreet) and a man of understanding.

Proverbs 18
Contrast The Upright And The Wicked
1He who [willfully] separates himself [from God and man] seeks his own desire,
He quarrels against all sound wisdom. 2A [closed-minded] fool does not delight in understanding,
But only in revealing his personal opinions [unwittingly displaying his self-indulgence and his stupidity]. 3When the wicked man comes [to the depth of evil], contempt [of all that is pure and good] also comes,
And with inner baseness (dishonor) comes outer shame (scorn). 4The words of a man’s mouth are like deep waters [copious and difficult to fathom];
The fountain of [mature, godly] wisdom is like a bubbling stream [sparkling, fresh, pure, and life-giving]. 5To show respect to the wicked person is not good,
Nor to push aside and deprive the righteous of justice. 6A fool’s lips bring contention and strife,
And his mouth invites a beating. 7A fool’s mouth is his ruin,
And his lips are the snare of his soul. 8The words of a whisperer (gossip) are like dainty morsels [to be greedily eaten];
They go down into the innermost chambers of the body [to be remembered and mused upon]. 9He who is careless in his work
Is a brother to him who destroys. 10The name of the LORD is a strong tower;
The righteous runs to it and is safe and set on high [far above evil]. 11The rich man’s wealth is his strong city,
And like a high wall [of protection] in his own imagination and conceit. 12Before disaster the heart of a man is haughty and filled with self-importance,
But humility comes before honor. 13He who answers before he hears [the facts]—
It is folly and shame to him. 14The spirit of a man sustains him in sickness,
But as for a broken spirit, who can bear it? 15The mind of the prudent [always] acquires knowledge,
And the ear of the wise [always] seeks knowledge. 16A man’s gift [given in love or courtesy] makes room for him
And brings him before great men. 17The first one to plead his case seems right,
Until another comes and cross-examines him. 18To cast lots puts an end to quarrels
And decides between powerful contenders. 19A brother offended is harder to win over than a fortified city,
And contentions [separating families] are like the bars of a castle. 20A man’s stomach will be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth;
He will be satisfied with the consequence of his words. 21Death and life are in the power of the tongue,
And those who love it and indulge it will eat its fruit and bear the consequences of their words. 22He who finds a [true and faithful] wife finds a good thing
And obtains favor and approval from the LORD. 23The poor man pleads,
But the rich man answers roughly. 24The man of too many friends [chosen indiscriminately] will be broken in pieces and come to ruin,
But there is a [true, loving] friend who [is reliable and] sticks closer than a brother.

Proverbs 19
On Life And Conduct
1Better is a poor man who walks in his integrity
Than a [rich] man who is twisted in his speech and is a [shortsighted] fool. 2Also it is not good for a person to be without knowledge,
And he who hurries with his feet [acting impulsively and proceeding without caution or analyzing the consequences] sins (misses the mark). 3The foolishness of man undermines his way [ruining whatever he undertakes];
Then his heart is resentful and rages against the LORD [for, being a fool, he blames the LORD instead of himself]. 4Wealth makes many friends,
But a poor man is separated from his friend. 5A false witness will not go unpunished,
And he who breathes out lies will not escape. 6Many will seek the favor of a generous and noble man,
And everyone is a friend to him who gives gifts. 7All the brothers of a poor man hate him;
How much more do his friends abandon him!
He pursues them with words, but they are gone. 8He who gains wisdom and good sense loves (preserves) his own soul;
He who keeps understanding will find good and prosper. 9A false witness will not go unpunished,
And he who breathes lies will perish. 10Luxury is not fitting for a fool;
Much less for a slave to rule over princes. 11Good sense and discretion make a man slow to anger,
And it is his honor and glory to overlook a transgression or an offense [without seeking revenge and harboring resentment]. 12The king’s wrath terrifies like the roaring of a lion,
But his favor is as [refreshing and nourishing as] dew on the grass. 13A foolish (ungodly) son is destruction to his father,
And the contentions of a [quarrelsome] wife are like a constant dripping [of water]. 14House and wealth are the inheritance from fathers,
But a wise, understanding, and sensible wife is [a gift and blessing] from the LORD. 15Laziness casts one into a deep sleep [unmindful of lost opportunity],
And the idle person will suffer hunger. 16He who keeps and obeys the commandment [of the LORD] keeps (guards) his own life,
But he who is careless of his ways and conduct will die. 17He who is gracious and lends a hand to the poor lends to the LORD,
And the LORD will repay him for his good deed. 18Discipline and teach your son while there is hope,
And do not [indulge your anger or resentment by imposing inappropriate punishment nor] desire his destruction. 19A man of great anger will bear the penalty [for his quick temper and lack of self-control];
For if you rescue him [and do not let him learn from the consequences of his action], you will only have to rescue him over and over again. 20Listen to counsel, receive instruction, and accept correction,
That you may be wise in the time to come. 21Many plans are in a man’s mind,
But it is the LORD’S purpose for him that will stand (be carried out). 22That which is desirable in a man is his loyalty and unfailing love,
But it is better to be a poor man than a [wealthy] liar. 23The fear of the LORD leads to life,
So that one may sleep satisfied, untouched by evil. 24The lazy man buries his hand in the [food] dish,
But will not even bring it to his mouth again. 25Strike a scoffer [for refusing to learn], and the naive may [be warned and] become prudent;
Reprimand one who has understanding and a teachable spirit, and he will gain knowledge and insight. 26He who assaults his father and chases away his mother
Is a son who brings shame and disgrace. 27Cease listening, my son, to instruction and discipline
And you will stray from the words of knowledge. 28A wicked and worthless witness mocks justice,
And the mouth of the wicked spreads iniquity. 29Judgments are prepared for scoffers,
And beatings for the backs of [thickheaded] fools.

Proverbs 20
On Life And Conduct
1Wine is a mocker, strong drink a riotous brawler;
And whoever is intoxicated by it is not wise. 2The terror of a king is like the roaring of a lion;
Whoever provokes him to anger forfeits his own life. 3It is an honor for a man to keep away from strife [by handling situations with thoughtful foresight],
But any fool will [start a] quarrel [without regard for the consequences]. 4The lazy man does not plow when the winter [planting] season arrives;
So he begs at the [next] harvest and has nothing [to reap]. 5A plan (motive, wise counsel) in the heart of a man is like water in a deep well,
But a man of understanding draws it out. 6Many a man proclaims his own loyalty and goodness,
But who can find a faithful and trustworthy man? 7The righteous man who walks in integrity and lives life in accord with his [godly] beliefs—
How blessed [happy and spiritually secure] are his children after him [who have his example to follow]. 8A [discerning] king who sits on the throne of judgment
Sifts all evil [like chaff] with his eyes [and cannot be easily fooled]. 9Who can say, “I have cleansed my heart,
I am pure from my sin?” 10Differing weights [one for buying and another for selling] and differing measures,
Both of them are detestable and offensive to the LORD. 11Even a boy is known and distinguished by his acts,
Whether his conduct is pure and right. 12The hearing ear and the seeing eye,
The [omnipotent] LORD has made both of them. 13Do not love [excessive] sleep, or you will become poor;
Open your eyes [so that you can do your work] and you will be satisfied with bread. 14“It is [almost] worthless, it is [almost] worthless,” says the buyer [as he negotiates the price];
But when he goes his way, then he boasts [about his bargain]. 15There is gold, and an abundance of pearls,
But the lips of knowledge are a vessel of preciousness [the most precious of all]. 16[The judge tells the creditor], “Take the clothes of one who is surety for a stranger;
And hold him in pledge [when he guarantees a loan] for foreigners.” 17Food gained by deceit is sweet to a man,
But afterward his mouth will be filled with gravel [just as sin may be sweet at first, but later its consequences bring despair]. 18Plans are established by counsel;
So make war [only] with wise guidance. 19He who goes about as a gossip reveals secrets;
Therefore do not associate with a gossip [who talks freely or flatters]. 20Whoever curses his father or his mother,
His lamp [of life] will be extinguished in time of darkness. 21An inheritance hastily gained [by greedy, unjust means] at the beginning
Will not be blessed in the end. 22Do not say, “I will repay evil”;
Wait [expectantly] for the LORD, and He will rescue and save you. 23Differing weights are detestable and offensive to the LORD,
And fraudulent scales are not good. 24Man’s steps are ordered and ordained by the LORD.
How then can a man [fully] understand his way? 25It is a trap for a man to [speak a vow of consecration and] say rashly, “It is holy!”
And [not until] afterward consider [whether he can fulfill it]. 26A wise king sifts out the wicked [from among the good]
And drives the [threshing] wheel over them [to separate the chaff from the grain]. 27The spirit (conscience) of man is the lamp of the LORD,
Searching and examining all the innermost parts of his being. 28Loyalty and mercy, truth and faithfulness, protect the king,
And he upholds his throne by lovingkindness. 29The glory of young men is their [physical] strength,
And the honor of aged men is their gray head [representing wisdom and experience]. 30Blows that wound cleanse away evil,
And strokes reach to the innermost parts.

Proverbs 21
On Life And Conduct
1The king’s heart is like channels of water in the hand of the LORD;
He turns it whichever way He wishes. 2Every man’s way is right in his own eyes,
But the LORD weighs and examines the hearts [of people and their motives]. 3To do righteousness and justice
Is more acceptable to the LORD than sacrifice [for wrongs repeatedly committed]. 4Haughty and arrogant eyes and a proud heart,
The lamp of the wicked [their self-centered pride], is sin [in the eyes of God]. 5The plans of the diligent lead surely to abundance and advantage,
But everyone who acts in haste comes surely to poverty. 6Acquiring treasures by a lying tongue
Is a fleeting vapor, the seeking and pursuit of death. 7The violence of the wicked will [return to them and] drag them away [like fish caught in a net],
Because they refuse to act with justice. 8The way of the guilty is [exceedingly] crooked,
But as for the pure, his conduct is upright. 9It is better to live in a corner of the housetop [on the flat roof, exposed to the weather]
Than in a house shared with a quarrelsome (contentious) woman. 10The soul of the wicked desires evil [like an addictive substance];
His neighbor finds no compassion in his eyes. 11When the scoffer is punished, the naive [observes the lesson and] becomes wise;
But when the wise and teachable person is instructed, he receives knowledge. 12The righteous one keeps an eye on the house of the wicked—
How the wicked are cast down to ruin. 13Whoever shuts his ears at the cry of the poor
Will cry out himself and not be answered. 14A gift in secret subdues anger,
And a bribe [hidden] in the pocket, strong wrath. 15When justice is done, it is a joy to the righteous (the upright, the one in right standing with God),
But to the evildoers it is disaster. 16A man who wanders from the way of understanding (godly wisdom)
Will remain in the assembly of the dead. 17He who loves [only selfish] pleasure will become a poor man;
He who loves and is devoted to wine and [olive] oil will not become rich. 18The wicked become a ransom for the righteous,
And the treacherous in the place of the upright [for they fall into their own traps]. 19It is better to dwell in a desert land
Than with a contentious and troublesome woman. 20There is precious treasure and oil in the house of the wise [who prepare for the future],
But a short-sighted and foolish man swallows it up and wastes it. 21He who earnestly seeks righteousness and loyalty
Finds life, righteousness, and honor. 22A wise man scales the city [walls] of the mighty
And brings down the stronghold in which they trust. 23He who guards his mouth and his tongue
Guards himself from troubles. 24“Proud,” “Haughty,” “Scoffer,” are his names
Who acts with overbearing and insolent pride. 25The desire of the lazy kills him,
For his hands refuse to labor; 26He craves all the day long [and does no work],
But the righteous [willingly] gives and does not withhold [what he has]. 27The sacrifice of the wicked is detestable and offensive [to the LORD].
How much more [unacceptable and insulting can it be] when he brings it with evil intention? 28A false witness will perish,
But a man who listens to the truth will speak forever and go unchallenged. 29A wicked man puts on a bold face,
But as for the upright, he considers, directs, and establishes his way [with the confidence of integrity]. 30There is no [human] wisdom or understanding
Or counsel [that can prevail] against the LORD. 31The horse is prepared for the day of battle,
But deliverance and victory belong to the LORD.

Proverbs 22
On Life And Conduct
1A good name [earned by honorable behavior, godly wisdom, moral courage, and personal integrity] is more desirable than great riches;
And favor is better than silver and gold. 2The rich and poor have a common bond;
The LORD is the Maker of them all. 3A prudent and far-sighted person sees the evil [of sin] and hides himself [from it],
But the naive continue on and are punished [by suffering the consequences of sin]. 4The reward of humility [that is, having a realistic view of one’s importance] and the [reverent, worshipful] fear of the LORD
Is riches, honor, and life. 5Thorns and snares are in the way of the obstinate [for their lack of honor and their wrong-doing traps them];
He who guards himself [with godly wisdom] will be far from them and avoid the consequences they suffer. 6Train up a child in the way he should go [teaching him to seek God’s wisdom and will for his abilities and talents],
Even when he is old he will not depart from it. 7The rich rules over the poor,
And the borrower is servant to the lender. 8He who sows injustice will reap [a harvest of] trouble,
And the rod of his wrath [with which he oppresses others] will fail. 9He who is generous will be blessed,
For he gives some of his food to the poor. 10Drive out the scoffer, and contention will go away;
Even strife and dishonor will cease. 11He who loves purity of heart
And whose speech is gracious will have the king as his friend. 12The eyes of the LORD keep guard over knowledge and the one who has it,
But He overthrows the words of the treacherous. 13The lazy one [manufactures excuses and] says, “There is a lion outside!
I will be killed in the streets [if I go out to work]!” 14The mouth of an immoral woman is a deep pit [deep and inescapable];
He who is cursed by the LORD [because of his adulterous sin] will fall into it. 15Foolishness is bound up in the heart of a child;
The rod of discipline [correction administered with godly wisdom and lovingkindness] will remove it far from him. 16He who oppresses or exploits the poor to get more for himself
Or who gives to the rich [to gain influence and favor], will only come to poverty. 17Listen carefully and hear the words of the wise,
And apply your mind to my knowledge; 18For it will be pleasant if you keep them in mind [incorporating them as guiding principles];
Let them be ready on your lips [to guide and strengthen yourself and others]. 19So that your trust and reliance and confidence may be in the LORD,
I have taught these things to you today, even to you. 20Have I not written to you excellent things
In counsels and knowledge, 21To let you know the certainty of the words of truth,
That you may give a correct answer to him who sent you? 22Do not rob the poor because he is poor [and defenseless],
Nor crush the afflicted [by legal proceedings] at the gate [where the city court is held], 23For the LORD will plead their case
And take the life of those who rob them. 24Do not even associate with a man given to angry outbursts;
Or go [along] with a hot-tempered man, 25Or you will learn his [undisciplined] ways
And get yourself trapped [in a situation from which it is hard to escape]. 26Do not be among those who give pledges [involving themselves in others’ finances],
Or among those who become guarantors for others’ debts. 27If you have nothing with which to pay [another’s debt when he defaults],
Why should his creditor take your bed from under you? 28Do not move the ancient landmark [at the boundary of the property]
Which your fathers have set. 29Do you see a man skillful and experienced in his work?
He will stand [in honor] before kings;
He will not stand before obscure men.

Proverbs 23
On Life And Conduct
1When you sit down to dine with a ruler,
Consider carefully what is [set] before you; 2For you will put a knife to your throat
If you are a man of great appetite. 3Do not desire his delicacies,
For it is deceptive food [offered to you with questionable motives]. 4Do not weary yourself [with the overwhelming desire] to gain wealth;
Cease from your own understanding of it. 5When you set your eyes on wealth, it is [suddenly] gone.
For wealth certainly makes itself wings
Like an eagle that flies to the heavens. 6Do not eat the bread of a selfish man,
Or desire his delicacies; 7For as he thinks in his heart, so is he [in behavior—one who manipulates].
He says to you, “Eat and drink,”
Yet his heart is not with you [but it is begrudging the cost]. 8The morsel which you have eaten you will vomit up,
And you will waste your compliments. 9Do not speak in the ears of a fool,
For he will despise the [godly] wisdom of your words. 10Do not move the ancient landmark [at the boundary of the property]
And do not go into the fields of the fatherless [to take what is theirs], 11For their Redeemer is strong and mighty;
He will plead their case against you. 12Apply your heart to discipline
And your ears to words of knowledge. 13Do not withhold discipline from the child;
If you swat him with a reed-like rod [applied with godly wisdom], he will not die. 14You shall swat him with the reed-like rod
And rescue his life from Sheol (the nether world, the place of the dead). 15My son, if your heart is wise,
My heart will also be glad; 16Yes, my heart will rejoice
When your lips speak right things. 17Do not let your heart envy sinners [who live godless lives and have no hope of salvation],
But [continue to] live in the [reverent, worshipful] fear of the LORD day by day. 18Surely there is a future [and a reward],
And your hope and expectation will not be cut off. 19Listen, my son, and be wise,
And direct your heart in the way [of the LORD]. 20Do not associate with heavy drinkers of wine,
Or with gluttonous eaters of meat, 21For the heavy drinker and the glutton will come to poverty,
And the drowsiness [of overindulgence] will clothe one with rags. 22Listen to your father, who sired you,
And do not despise your mother when she is old. 23Buy truth, and do not sell it;
Get wisdom and instruction and understanding. 24The father of the righteous will greatly rejoice,
And he who sires a wise child will have joy in him. 25Let your father and your mother be glad,
And let her who gave birth to you rejoice [in your wise and godly choices]. 26My son, give me your heart
And let your eyes delight in my ways, 27For a prostitute is a deep pit,
And an immoral woman is a narrow well. 28She lurks and lies in wait like a robber [who waits for prey],
And she increases the faithless among men. 29Who has woe? Who has sorrow?
Who has strife? Who has complaining?
Who has wounds without cause?
Whose eyes are red and dim? 30Those who linger long over wine,
Those who go to taste mixed wine. 31Do not look at wine when it is red,
When it sparkles in the glass,
When it goes down smoothly. 32At the last it bites like a serpent
And stings like a viper. 33Your [drunken] eyes will see strange things
And your mind will utter perverse things [untrue things, twisted things]. 34And you will be [as unsteady] as one who lies down in the middle of the sea,
And [as vulnerable to disaster] as one who lies down on the top of a ship’s mast, saying, 35“They struck me, but I was not hurt!
They beat me, but I did not feel it!
When will I wake up?
I will seek more wine.”

Proverbs 24
Precepts And Warnings
1Do not be envious of evil men,
Nor desire to be with them; 2For their minds plot violence,
And their lips talk of trouble [for the innocent]. 3Through [skillful and godly] wisdom a house [a life, a home, a family] is built,
And by understanding it is established [on a sound and good foundation], 4And by knowledge its rooms are filled
With all precious and pleasant riches. 5A wise man is strong,
And a man of knowledge strengthens his power; 6For by wise guidance you can wage your war,
And in an abundance of [wise] counselors there is victory and safety. 7Wisdom is too exalted for a [hardened, arrogant] fool;
He does not open his mouth in the gate [where the city’s rulers sit in judgment]. 8He who plans to do evil
Will be called a schemer or deviser of evil. 9The devising of folly is sin,
And the scoffer is repulsive to men. 10If you are slack (careless) in the day of distress,
Your strength is limited. 11Rescue those who are being taken away to death,
And those who stagger to the slaughter, Oh hold them back [from their doom]! 12If you [claim ignorance and] say, “See, we did not know this,”
Does He not consider it who weighs and examines the hearts and their motives?
And does He not know it who guards your life and keeps your soul?
And will He not repay [you and] every man according to his works? 13My son, eat honey, because it is good,
And the drippings of the honeycomb are sweet to your taste. 14Know that [skillful and godly] wisdom is [so very good] for your life and soul;
If you find wisdom, then there will be a future and a reward,
And your hope and expectation will not be cut off. 15Do not lie in wait, O wicked man, against the dwelling of the righteous;
Do not destroy his resting place; 16For a righteous man falls seven times, and rises again,
But the wicked stumble in time of disaster and collapse. 17Do not rejoice and gloat when your enemy falls,
And do not let your heart be glad [in self-righteousness] when he stumbles, 18Or the LORD will see your gloating and be displeased,
And turn His anger away from your enemy. 19Do not get upset because of evildoers,
Or be envious of the wicked, 20For there will be no future for the evil man;
The lamp of the wicked will be put out. 21My son, fear the LORD and the king;
And do not associate with those who are given to change [of allegiance, and are revolutionary], 22For their tragedy will rise suddenly,
And who knows the punishment that both [the LORD and the king] will bring on the rebellious? 23These also are sayings of the wise:
To show partiality in judgment is not good. 24He who says to the wicked, “You are righteous,”
Peoples will curse him, nations will denounce him; 25But to those [honorable judges] who rebuke the wicked, it will go well with them and they will find delight,
And a good blessing will come upon them. 26He kisses the lips [and wins the hearts of people]
Who gives a right and straightforward answer. 27Prepare your work outside
And get it ready for yourself in the field;
Afterward build your house and establish a home. 28Do not be a witness against your neighbor without cause,
And do not deceive with your lips [speak neither lies nor half-truths]. 29Do not say, “I will do to him as he has done to me;
I will pay the man back for his deed.” 30I went by the field of the lazy man,
And by the vineyard of the man lacking understanding and common sense; 31And, behold, it was all overgrown with thorns,
And nettles were covering its surface,
And its stone wall was broken down. 32When I saw, I considered it well;
I looked and received instruction. 33“Yet a little sleep, a little slumber,
A little folding of the hands to rest [and daydream],” 34Then your poverty will come as a robber,
And your want like an armed man.

Proverbs 25
Similitudes, Instructions
1These are also the proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied: 2It is the glory of God to conceal a matter,
But the glory of kings is to search out a matter. 3As the heavens for height and the earth for depth,
So the hearts and minds of kings are unsearchable. 4Take away the dross from the silver,
And there comes out [the pure metal for] a vessel for the silversmith [to shape]. 5Take away the wicked from before the king,
And his throne will be established in righteousness. 6Do not be boastfully ambitious and claim honor in the presence of the king,
And do not stand in the place of great men; 7For it is better that it be said to you, “Come up here,”
Than for you to be placed lower in the presence of the prince,
Whom your eyes have seen. 8Do not rush out to argue your case [before magistrates or judges];
Otherwise what will you do in the end [when your case is lost and]
When your neighbor (opponent) humiliates you? 9Argue your case with your neighbor himself [before you go to court];
And do not reveal another’s secret, 10Or he who hears it will shame you
And the rumor about you [and your action in court] will have no end. 11Like apples of gold in settings of silver
Is a word spoken at the right time. 12Like an earring of gold and an ornament of fine gold
Is a wise reprover to an ear that listens and learns. 13Like the cold of snow [brought from the mountains] in the time of harvest,
So is a faithful messenger to those who send him;
For he refreshes the life of his masters. 14Like clouds and wind without rain
Is a man who boasts falsely of gifts [he does not give]. 15By patience and a calm spirit a ruler may be persuaded,
And a soft and gentle tongue breaks the bone [of resistance]. 16Have you found [pleasure sweet like] honey? Eat only as much as you need,
Otherwise, being filled excessively, you vomit it. 17Let your foot seldom be in your neighbor’s house,
Or he will become tired of you and hate you. 18Like a club and a sword and a piercing arrow
Is a man who testifies falsely against his neighbor (acquaintance). 19Like a broken tooth or an unsteady foot
Is confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble. 20Like one who takes off a garment in cold weather, or like [a reactive, useless mixture of] vinegar on soda,
Is he who [thoughtlessly] sings [joyful] songs to a heavy heart. 21If your enemy is hungry, give him bread to eat;
And if he is thirsty, give him water to drink; 22For in doing so, you will heap coals of fire upon his head,
And the LORD will reward you. 23The north wind brings forth rain;
And a backbiting tongue, an angry countenance. 24It is better to live in a corner of the housetop [on the flat roof, exposed to the weather]
Than in a house shared with a quarrelsome (contentious) woman. 25Like cold water to a thirsty soul,
So is good news from a distant land. 26Like a muddied fountain and a polluted spring
Is a righteous man who yields and compromises his integrity before the wicked. 27It is not good to eat much honey,
Nor is it glorious to seek one’s own glory. 28Like a city that is broken down and without walls [leaving it unprotected]
Is a man who has no self-control over his spirit [and sets himself up for trouble].

Proverbs 26
Similitudes, Instructions
1Like snow in summer and like rain in harvest,
So honor is not fitting for a [shortsighted] fool. 2Like the sparrow in her wandering, like the swallow in her flying,
So the curse without cause does not come and alight [on the undeserving]. 3A whip for the horse, a bridle for the donkey,
And a rod for the backs of fools [who refuse to learn]. 4Do not answer [nor pretend to agree with the frivolous comments of] a [closed-minded] fool according to his folly,
Otherwise you, even you, will be like him. 5Answer [and correct the erroneous concepts of] a fool according to his folly,
Otherwise he will be wise in his own eyes [if he thinks you agree with him]. 6He who sends a message by the hand of a fool
Cuts off his own feet (sabotages himself) and drinks the violence [it brings on himself as a consequence]. 7Like the legs which are useless to the lame,
So is a proverb in the mouth of a fool [who cannot learn from its wisdom]. 8Like one who [absurdly] binds a stone in a sling [making it impossible to throw],
So is he who [absurdly] gives honor to a fool. 9Like a thorn that goes [without being felt] into the hand of a drunken man,
So is a proverb in the mouth of a fool [who remains unaffected by its wisdom]. 10Like a [careless] archer who [shoots arrows wildly and] wounds everyone,
So is he who hires a fool or those who [by chance just] pass by. 11Like a dog that returns to his vomit
Is a fool who repeats his foolishness. 12Do you see a man [who is unteachable and] wise in his own eyes and full of self-conceit?
There is more hope for a fool than for him. 13The lazy person [who is self-indulgent and relies on lame excuses] says, “There is a lion in the road!
A lion is in the open square [and if I go outside to work I will be killed]!” 14As the door turns on its hinges,
So does the lazy person on his bed [never getting out of it]. 15The lazy person buries his hand in the dish [losing opportunity after opportunity];
It wearies him to bring it back to his mouth. 16The lazy person is wiser in his own eyes
Than seven [sensible] men who can give a discreet answer. 17Like one who grabs a dog by the ears [and is likely to be bitten]
Is he who, passing by, stops to meddle with a dispute that is none of his business. 18Like a madman who throws
Firebrands, arrows, and death, 19So is the man who deceives his neighbor (acquaintance, friend)
And then says, “Was I not joking?” 20For lack of wood the fire goes out,
And where there is no whisperer [who gossips], contention quiets down. 21Like charcoal to hot embers and wood to fire,
So is a contentious man to kindle strife. 22The words of a whisperer (gossip) are like dainty morsels [to be greedily eaten];
They go down into the innermost chambers of the body [to be remembered and mused upon]. 23Like a [common] clay vessel covered with the silver dross [making it appear silver when it has no real value]
Are burning lips [murmuring manipulative words] and a wicked heart. 24He who hates, disguises it with his lips,
But he stores up deceit in his heart. 25When he speaks graciously and kindly [to conceal his malice], do not trust him,
For seven abominations are in his heart. 26Though his hatred covers itself with guile and deceit,
His malevolence will be revealed openly before the assembly. 27Whoever digs a pit [for another man’s feet] will fall into it,
And he who rolls a stone [up a hill to do mischief], it will come back on him. 28A lying tongue hates those it wounds and crushes,
And a flattering mouth works ruin.

Proverbs 27
Warnings And Instructions
1Do not boast about tomorrow,
For you do not know what a day may bring. 2Let another praise you, and not your own mouth;
A stranger, and not your own lips. 3Stone is heavy and the sand weighty,
But a fool’s [unreasonable] wrath is heavier and more burdensome than both of them. 4Wrath is cruel and anger is an overwhelming flood,
But who is able to endure and stand before [the sin of] jealousy? 5Better is an open reprimand [of loving correction]
Than love that is hidden. 6Faithful are the wounds of a friend [who corrects out of love and concern],
But the kisses of an enemy are deceitful [because they serve his hidden agenda]. 7He who is satisfied loathes honey,
But to the hungry soul any bitter thing is sweet. 8Like a bird that wanders from her nest [with its comfort and safety],
So is a man who wanders from his home. 9Oil and perfume make the heart glad;
So does the sweetness of a friend’s counsel that comes from the heart. 10Do not abandon your own friend and your father’s friend,
And do not go to your brother’s house in the day of your disaster.
Better is a neighbor who is near than a brother who is far away. 11My son, be wise, and make my heart glad,
That I may reply to him who reproaches (reprimands, criticizes) me. 12A prudent man sees evil and hides himself and avoids it,
But the naive [who are easily misled] continue on and are punished [by suffering the consequences of sin]. 13[The judge tells the creditor,] “Take the garment of one who is surety (guarantees a loan) for a stranger;
And hold him in pledge when he is surety for an immoral woman [for it is unlikely the debt will be repaid].” 14He who blesses his neighbor with a loud voice early in the morning,
It will be counted as a curse to him [for it will either be annoying or his purpose will be suspect]. 15A constant dripping on a day of steady rain
And a contentious (quarrelsome) woman are alike; 16Whoever attempts to restrain her [criticism] might as well try to stop the wind,
And grasps oil with his right hand. 17As iron sharpens iron,
So one man sharpens [and influences] another [through discussion]. 18He who tends the fig tree will eat its fruit,
And he who faithfully protects and cares for his master will be honored. 19As in water face reflects face,
So the heart of man reflects man. 20Sheol (the place of the dead) and Abaddon (the underworld) are never satisfied;
Nor are the eyes of man ever satisfied. 21The refining pot is for silver and the furnace for gold [to separate the impurities of the metal],
And each is tested by the praise given to him [and his response to it, whether humble or proud]. 22Even though you pound a [hardened, arrogant] fool [who rejects wisdom] in a mortar with a pestle like grain,
Yet his foolishness will not leave him. 23Be diligent to know the condition of your flocks,
And pay attention to your herds; 24For riches are not forever,
Nor does a crown endure to all generations. 25When the grass is gone, the new growth is seen,
And herbs of the mountain are gathered in, 26The lambs will supply wool for your clothing,
And the goats will bring the price of a field. 27And there will be enough goats’ milk for your food,
For the food of your household,
And for the maintenance of your maids.

Proverbs 28
Warnings And Instructions
1The wicked flee when no one pursues them,
But the righteous are as bold as a lion. 2When a land does wrong, it has many princes,
But when the ruler is a man of understanding and knowledge, its stability endures. 3A poor man who oppresses and exploits the lowly
Is like a sweeping rain which leaves no food. 4Those who set aside the law [of God and man] praise the wicked,
But those who keep the law [of God and man] struggle with them. 5Evil men do not understand justice,
But they who long for and seek the LORD understand it fully. 6Better is the poor who walks in his integrity
Than he who is crooked and two-faced though he is rich. 7He who keeps the law [of God and man] is a wise and discerning son,
But he who is a companion of gluttons humiliates his father [and himself]. 8He who increases his wealth by interest and usury (excessive interest)
Gathers it for him who is gracious to the poor. 9He who turns his ear away from listening to the law [of God and man],
Even his prayer is repulsive [to God]. 10He who leads the upright astray on an evil path
Will himself fall into his own pit,
But the blameless will inherit good. 11The rich man [who is conceited and relies on his wealth instead of God] is wise in his own eyes,
But the poor man who has understanding [because he relies on God] is able to see through him. 12When the righteous triumph, there is great glory and celebration;
But when the wicked rise [to prominence], men hide themselves. 13He who conceals his transgressions will not prosper,
But whoever confesses and turns away from his sins will find compassion and mercy. 14Blessed and favored by God is the man who fears [sin and its consequence] at all times,
But he who hardens his heart [and is determined to sin] will fall into disaster. 15Like a roaring lion and a charging bear
Is a wicked ruler over a poor people. 16A leader who is a great oppressor lacks understanding and common sense [and his wickedness shortens his days],
But he who hates unjust gain will [be blessed and] prolong his days. 17A man who is burdened with the guilt of human blood (murder)
Will be a fugitive until death; let no one support him or give him refuge. 18He who walks blamelessly and uprightly will be kept safe,
But he who is crooked (perverse) will suddenly fall. 19He who cultivates his land will have plenty of bread,
But he who follows worthless people and frivolous pursuits will have plenty of poverty. 20A faithful (right-minded) man will abound with blessings,
But he who hurries to be rich will not go unpunished. 21To have regard for one person over another and to show favoritism is not good,
Because for a piece of bread a man will transgress. 22He who has an evil and envious eye hurries to be rich
And does not know that poverty will come upon him. 23He who [appropriately] reprimands a [wise] man will afterward find more favor
Than he who flatters with the tongue. 24He who robs his father or his mother
And says, “This is no sin,”
Is [not only a thief but also] the companion of a man who destroys. 25An arrogant and greedy man stirs up strife,
But he who trusts in the LORD will be blessed and prosper. 26He who trusts confidently in his own heart is a [dull, thickheaded] fool,
But he who walks in [skillful and godly] wisdom will be rescued. 27He who gives to the poor will never want,
But he who shuts his eyes [from their need] will have many curses. 28When the wicked rise [to power], men hide themselves;
But when the wicked perish, the [consistently] righteous increase and become great.

Proverbs 29
Warnings And Instructions
1He who hardens his neck and refuses instruction after being often reproved (corrected, criticized),
Will suddenly be broken beyond repair. 2When the righteous are in authority and become great, the people rejoice;
But when the wicked man rules, the people groan and sigh. 3A man who loves [skillful and godly] wisdom makes his father joyful,
But he who associates with prostitutes wastes his wealth. 4The king establishes (stabilizes) the land by justice,
But a man who takes bribes overthrows it. 5A man who flatters his neighbor [with smooth words intending to do harm]
Is spreading a net for his own feet. 6By his wicked plan an evil man is trapped,
But the righteous man sings and rejoices [for his plan brings good things to him]. 7The righteous man cares for the rights of the poor,
But the wicked man has no interest in such knowledge. 8Scoffers set a city afire [by stirring up trouble],
But wise men turn away anger [and restore order with their good judgment]. 9If a wise man has a controversy with a foolish and arrogant man,
The foolish man [ignores logic and fairness and] only rages or laughs, and there is no peace (rest, agreement). 10The bloodthirsty hate the blameless [because of his integrity],
But the upright are concerned for his life. 11A [shortsighted] fool always loses his temper and displays his anger,
But a wise man [uses self-control and] holds it back. 12If a ruler pays attention to lies [and encourages corruption],
All his officials will become wicked. 13The poor man and the oppressor have this in common:
The LORD gives light to the eyes of both. 14If a king faithfully and truthfully judges the poor,
His throne shall be established forever. 15The rod and reproof (godly instruction) give wisdom,
But a child who gets his own way brings shame to his mother. 16When the wicked are in authority, transgression increases,
But the righteous will see the downfall of the wicked. 17Correct your son, and he will give you comfort;
Yes, he will delight your soul. 18Where there is no vision [no revelation of God and His word], the people are unrestrained;
But happy and blessed is he who keeps the law [of God]. 19A servant will not be corrected by words alone;
For though he understands, he will not respond [nor pay attention]. 20Do you see a [conceited] man who speaks quickly [offering his opinions or answering without thinking]?
There is more hope for a [thickheaded] fool than for him. 21He who pampers his slave from childhood
Will find him to be a son in the end. 22An angry man stirs up strife,
And a hot-tempered and undisciplined man commits many transgressions. 23A man’s pride and sense of self-importance will bring him down,
But he who has a humble spirit will obtain honor. 24Whoever is partner with a thief hates his own life;
He hears the curse [when swearing an oath to testify], but discloses nothing [and commits perjury by omission]. 25The fear of man brings a snare,
But whoever trusts in and puts his confidence in the LORD will be exalted and safe. 26Many seek the ruler’s favor,
But justice for man comes from the LORD. 27An unjust man is repulsive to the righteous,
And he who is upright in the way [of the LORD] is repulsive to the wicked.

Proverbs 30
The Words Of Agur
1The words of Agur the son of Jakeh, the oracle:

The man says to Ithiel, to Ithiel and to Ucal: 2Surely I am more brutish and stupid than any man,
And I do not have the understanding of a man [for I do not know what I do not know]. 3I have not learned [skillful and godly] wisdom,
Nor do I have knowledge of the Holy One [who is the source of wisdom]. 4Who has ascended into heaven and descended?
Who has gathered the wind in His fists?
Who has bound the waters in His garment?
Who has established all the ends of the earth?
What is His name, and what is His Son’s name?
Certainly you know! 5Every word of God is tested and refined [like silver];
He is a shield to those who trust and take refuge in Him. 6Do not add to His words,
Or He will reprove you, and you will be found a liar. 7Two things I have asked of You;
Do not deny them to me before I die: 8Keep deception and lies far from me;
Give me neither poverty nor riches;
Feed me with the food that is my portion, 9So that I will not be full and deny You and say, “Who is the LORD?”
Or that I will not be poor and steal,
And so profane the name of my God. 10Do not slander or malign a servant before his master [stay out of another’s personal life],
Or he will curse you [for your interference], and you will be found guilty. 11There is a generation (class of people) that curses its father
And does not bless its mother. 12There is a generation (class of people) that is pure in its own eyes,
Yet is not washed from its filthiness. 13There is a generation (class of people)—oh, how lofty are their eyes!
And their eyelids are raised in arrogance. 14There is a generation (class of people) whose teeth are like swords
And whose jaw teeth are like knives,
To devour the afflicted from the earth
And the needy from among men. 15The leech has two daughters,
“Give, give!”
There are three things that are never satisfied,
Four that do not say, “It is enough”: 16Sheol, and the barren womb,
Earth that is never satisfied with water,
And fire that never says, “It is enough.” 17The eye that mocks a father
And scorns a mother,
The ravens of the valley will pick it out,
And the young vultures will devour it. 18There are three things which are too astounding and unexpectedly wonderful for me,
Four which I do not understand: 19The way of an eagle in the air,
The way of a serpent on a rock,
The way of a ship in the middle of the sea,
And the way of a man with a maid. 20This is the way of an adulterous woman:
She eats and wipes her mouth
And says, “I have done no wrong.” 21Under three things the earth is disquieted and quakes,
And under four it cannot bear up: 22Under a servant when he reigns,
Under a [spiritually blind] fool when he is filled with food, 23Under an unloved woman when she gets married,
And under a maidservant when she supplants her mistress. 24There are four things that are small on the earth,
But they are exceedingly wise: 25The ants are not a strong people,
Yet they prepare their food in the summer; 26The shephanim are not a mighty folk,
Yet they make their houses in the rocks; 27The locusts have no king,
Yet all of them go out in groups; 28You may grasp the lizard with your hands,
Yet it is in kings’ palaces. 29There are three things which are stately in step,
Even four which are stately in their stride: 30The lion, which is mighty among beasts
And does not turn back before any; 31The strutting rooster, the male goat also,
And the king when his army is with him. 32If you have foolishly exalted yourself,
Or if you have plotted evil, put your hand on your mouth. 33Surely the churning of milk produces butter,
And wringing the nose produces blood;
So the churning of anger produces strife.

Proverbs 31
The Words Of Lemuel
1The words of King Lemuel, the oracle, which his mother taught him: 2What, O my son?
And what, O son of my womb?
And what [shall I advise you], O son of my vows? 3Do not give your [generative] strength to women [neither foreign wives in marriages of alliances, nor concubines],
Nor your ways to that which destroys kings. 4It is not for kings, O Lemuel,
It is not for kings to drink wine,
Or for rulers to desire strong drink, 5Otherwise they drink and forget the law and its decrees,
And pervert the rights and justice of all the afflicted. 6Give strong drink [as medicine] to him who is ready to pass away,
And wine to him whose life is bitter. 7Let him drink and forget his poverty
And no longer remember his trouble. 8Open your mouth for the mute,
For the rights of all who are unfortunate and defenseless; 9Open your mouth, judge righteously,
And administer justice for the afflicted and needy. Description of a Worthy Woman 10An excellent woman [one who is spiritual, capable, intelligent, and virtuous], who is he who can find her?
Her value is more precious than jewels and her worth is far above rubies or pearls. 11The heart of her husband trusts in her [with secure confidence],
And he will have no lack of gain. 12She comforts, encourages, and does him only good and not evil
All the days of her life. 13She looks for wool and flax
And works with willing hands in delight. 14She is like the merchant ships [abounding with treasure];
She brings her [household’s] food from far away. 15She rises also while it is still night
And gives food to her household
And assigns tasks to her maids. 16She considers a field before she buys or accepts it [expanding her business prudently];
With her profits she plants fruitful vines in her vineyard. 17She equips herself with strength [spiritual, mental, and physical fitness for her God-given task]
And makes her arms strong. 18She sees that her gain is good;
Her lamp does not go out, but it burns continually through the night [she is prepared for whatever lies ahead]. 19She stretches out her hands to the distaff,
And her hands hold the spindle [as she spins wool into thread for clothing]. 20She opens and extends her hand to the poor,
And she reaches out her filled hands to the needy. 21She does not fear the snow for her household,
For all in her household are clothed in [expensive] scarlet [wool]. 22She makes for herself coverlets, cushions, and rugs of tapestry.
Her clothing is linen, pure and fine, and purple [wool]. 23Her husband is known in the [city’s] gates,
When he sits among the elders of the land. 24She makes [fine] linen garments and sells them;
And supplies sashes to the merchants. 25Strength and dignity are her clothing and her position is strong and secure;
And she smiles at the future [knowing that she and her family are prepared]. 26She opens her mouth in [skillful and godly] wisdom,
And the teaching of kindness is on her tongue [giving counsel and instruction]. 27She looks well to how things go in her household,
And does not eat the bread of idleness. 28Her children rise up and call her blessed (happy, prosperous, to be admired);
Her husband also, and he praises her, saying, 29“Many daughters have done nobly, and well [with the strength of character that is steadfast in goodness],
But you excel them all.” 30Charm and grace are deceptive, and [superficial] beauty is vain,
But a woman who fears the LORD [reverently worshiping, obeying, serving, and trusting Him with awe-filled respect], she shall be praised. 31Give her of the product of her hands,
And let her own works praise her in the gates [of the city].
